# Infocons...

* Create your own animated gif's , from various image file types , for use as icons and favicons...
* Generate qr-codes as scannable links to urls in the process.
* Trigger migration events 'onclick'.
* Trigger Mp3 audio files containing spoken word data (audio 'readme' = 'listen2me' for visually impaired individuals and people with 'learning difficulties'.
* Engaging interactivity - information-transmission-purpose built... "INFO-Cons".
* Transform URL's in to QR-Codes.
* Create from : .jpg , .jpeg , webp ,svg , .gif, .png , .bmp

# infocon-mp3.html

* The file of this name (in the repo) provides an example using the same animated.gif (+qr-code) to trigger an audio mp3 event , without using an mp3 player , from a remote url.
* These 'digital objects' contain multiple layers of DATA in 'Human recognisable' formats , that can be extracted or triggered by multiple methods.(including scanning the qr-code.
* The 'VOICE' in the above illustration was generated by converting written text (English lang) in to 'javascript Object Notation' and then used as 'input' for a Model that uses
*  'Multi layer perceptrons (Artificial neural network), the 'output of the MLP is then transformed in to .mp3 format resembling Human Speech.
* In the example provided  we use an 'interface' we developed called 'Eve', the interface provides the model (tts-1) with input and enables the reception of the tts-1 'output'.
* This is based on the openai project called 'Whisper' and the voice you hear talking when you trigger the event by clicking the animated gif (generated by the code provided)
* is an AI voice called "Shimmer".
* Eve is located here : https://eve-red.vercel.app/

# URL-2-QR

* Navigate to root dir (after copying the python scripts to the folder of your choice).
* Create a folder called 'input' and place the image files you want to use in the folder.
* Edit the line in icon-qr.py ; # Specify download link for the QR code ; download_links = ["https://psicodata.io/CDN/img/animated.gif"]
* Replace the url with the url you want to create a qr code for (in the example we create a 'strange loop' by creating a qr code of the url that leads to the animated gif !
* The 'strange loop' is a concept introduced in the book ; Gödel, Escher, Bach: an Eternal Golden Braid, also known as GEB,  1979  by Douglas Hofstadter. 
* With python3 installed , in the IDE of your choice type;
* ```python icon-qr.py```
* animated.gif generated to output folder.

# Notes
1. Added QR Code Generation Function: 

    - `create_qr_code_with_links(links, qr_size=128)
	
: This function generates QR codes based on the input URLs and resizes them to a specified size.

2. Incorporating QR Codes in Animated GIF:

 - QR codes generated from the input URLs are stored in `qr_code_images`
 
 - The QR code images are added to the `images` list along with the resized images from the input folder files.

3.Updated `create_animated_gif_from_images` Function:

 - Along with resizing and adding images, the function now includes QR code images generated from the 
 
 download links.

4. Specifying Download Links and Output Size:

 - `download_links`: List of URLs used to generate QR codes.
 
 - `output_size`: Size for resizing the images and QR codes.

5. Generating Animated GIF:

 - The `imageio.mimsave` function is used to create the final animated GIF with a duration of

0.5 seconds per frame.

6. Usage Instructions:

 - Update `input_folder_path`, `output_folder_path`, and other variables as needed.
	
 - The script processes images from the input folder, generates QR codes for the specified URLs,

combines them, and produces an animated GIF.

This script allows you to create animated GIFs that include both images from the input folder and QR codes

 linked to download URLs.

 You can run this script similarly to ,
 
 adapting it to create animated GIFs with a blend of images and QR codes based on your requirements.
