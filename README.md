# infocon-mp3.html

* The file of this name (in the repo) provides an example using the same animated.gif (+qr-code) to trigger an audio mp3 event , without using an mp3 player , from a remote url.
* These 'digital objects' contain multiple layers of DATA in 'Human recognisable' formats , that can be extracted or triggered by multiple methods.(including scanning the qr-code.
* The 'VOICE' in the above illustration was generated by converting written text (English lang) in to 'javascript Object Notation' and then used as 'input' for a Model that uses
*  'Multi layer perceptrons (Artificial neural network), the 'output of the MLP is then transformed in to .mp3 format resembling Human Speech.
* In the example provided  we use an 'interface' we developed called 'Eve', the interface provides the model (tts-1) with input and enables the reception of the tts-1 'output'.
* This is based on the openai project called 'Whisper' and the voice you hear talking when you trigger the event by clicking the animated gif (generated by the code provided)
* is an AI voice called "  ".
* Eve is located here :
