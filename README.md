# infocon-mp3.html

* The file of this name (in the repo) provides an example using the same animated.gif (+qr-code) to trigger an audio mp3 event , without using an mp3 player , from a remote url.
* These 'digital objects' contain multiple layers of DATA in 'Human recognisable' formats , that can be extracted or triggered by multiple methods.(including scanning the qr-code.
* The 'VOICE' in the above illustration was generated by converting written text (English lang) in to 'javascript Object Notation' and then used as 'input' for a Model that uses
*  'Multi layer perceptrons (Artificial neural network), the 'output of the MLP is then transformed in to .mp3 format resembling Human Speech.
* In the example provided  we use an 'interface' we developed called 'Eve', the interface provides the model (tts-1) with input and enables the reception of the tts-1 'output'.
* This is based on the openai project called 'Whisper' and the voice you hear talking when you trigger the event by clicking the animated gif (generated by the code provided)
* is an AI voice called "Shimmer".
* Eve is located here : https://eve-red.vercel.app/

# URL-2-QR

* Navigate to root dir (after copying the python scripts to the folder of your choice).
* Create a folder called 'input' and place the image files you want to use in the folder.
* Edit the line in icon-qr.py ; # Specify download link for the QR code ; download_links = ["https://psicodata.io/CDN/img/animated.gif"]
* Replace the url with the url you want to create a qr code for (in the example we create a 'strange loop' by creating a qr code of the url that leads to the animated gif !
* The 'strange loop' is a concept introduced in the book ; GÃ¶del, Escher, Bach: an Eternal Golden Braid, also known as GEB,  1979  by Douglas Hofstadter. 
* With python3 installed , in the IDE of your choice type;
* ```python icon-qr.py```
